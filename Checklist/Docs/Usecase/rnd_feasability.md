# Use Case - R&D Projects

R&D projects usually follow a certain workflow, while it is better to implement this workflow in the **Workflow** module many parts of this workflow can be handled by checklists. Very often R&D projects have to do a feasability analysis befor the project goes further into development. This feasability analysis could be done in a checklist.

A feasability checklist could contain the following tasks:

* Market assessment
* Analysis of R&D requirements
* Cost-benefit analysis (CBA)
