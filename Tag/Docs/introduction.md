## Timed Release

Articles can be written in advanced and stored as a draft for further adjustments. In case an article should be released at a specific date/time this can also be configured.

## Permissions & Groups

By assigning permissions and groups to articles it's possible to only make them visible to intended audiences and different pages (e.g. intranet, website, blog etc.).

## Localization

News articles can get assigned to a language upon which it will be visible only to those who have the same language configuration. This allows organizations to target news articles not only by groups and permissions but also by localization.
