# Features

## Scheduling

The module allows to schedule events in a calender for the project. It's easy to see when which events such as meetings for this project take place.

It's possible to define milestones and assign tasks to them. This allows to generate a milestone overview (Gantt Chart) with dependencies to keep track of the project progression. By using tasks everyone can see who is responsible for which todos. 

## Budgeting

Cost and Return can be managed in the project as well in order to keep track of these.

## Media

Often media files are associated with projects which can be managed as well.

## Emails

Emails and internal conversations can be assigned to projects either privately or publicly.
