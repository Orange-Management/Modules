# Finance Statement

Every business has to do either annual or even monthly financial statements. These often contain the same task for every month/year. With the **Checklist** module it's possible to create a checklist for the financial statement, assign the responsible personnel and automatically create tasks and sub tasks for everyone. 

In the checklist itself it's easy to sea who is doing which tasks and their status. Checklists are often part of financial guidelines and with this module it's possible to easily integrate them and even use them for auditing purposes.

A financial statement checklist could contain the following tasks:

* Assets
* Inventor
* Cut-Off
* Accruals
* Cash
